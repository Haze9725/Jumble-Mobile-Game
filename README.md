# Jumble-Mobile-Game
Mobile picture puzzle game developed in Android Studio using Java

## To improve this project
- Switch statement is long and unnecessary, a new method should be created to adjust this project and make the codebase within Play.java much smaller 
- small functionality additions would be worthwhile, such as saving the score when the app is closed, the scores are available until app is force-closed

### Important Note
- This project uses JSON retrieval from a website, if this website ceases to exist then the project cannot run
